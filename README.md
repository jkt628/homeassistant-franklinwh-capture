# Capture FranklinWH app functions

test every aspect of FranklinWH app that could be interesting to Home Assistant, starting with the more useful stuff.
capture and export with [HTTP Toolkit] for future reference and redo after upgrades.

[Maestro]: https://docs.maestro.dev

[Maestro] provides the automation for UI coverage.  
consider test automation with **BOTH** FranklinWH and Home Assistant apps, *i.e.*, ensure changes in HA reflect in FWH.

i do not have optional components like [Smart Circuits] or [Generator Module].

i do participate in *Virtual Power Plant* ([VPP]) so capture an event sometime.

### Settings

![Settings](images/Screenshot_20250927-100600_FranklinWH.png)

configure the [aGate].  there are a lot of settings, figure out which are interesting to capture.

### More

these settings are probably less interesting to Home Assistant integration.

## Setup

### Set up phone / tablet

* install [HTTP Toolkit].
* install [FranklinWH].
* configure the following in *Settings*:
  * set *Screen timeout* to 10 minutes.
  * enable [Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
  * enable *USB debugging*.

* hook a USB cable between desktop and phone / tablet.

  ```bash

## Automation

### [FranklinWH.yaml](./FranklinWH.yaml)

tests many functions in [FranklinWH].

[FranklinWH]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Franklinwh.FamilyEnergy

### [Off-Grid](./Off-Grid.yaml)

tests Off- and On-Grid separately due to the disruption and many minutes required to complete the test.

> [!WARNING]
> *Screen timeout* **MUST BE** at least 10 minutes because each phase can take a long time to recover.

## Capture

### Capture phone / tablet

* unlock your phone / tablet

### Capture on desktop

* due to a long standing [bug in Maestro](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/Maestro/issues/1927) kill **Maestro Studio**.

* launch [HTTP Toolkit] via menus, or

  ```bash
  httptoolkit
  ```

  * click **Android Device via ADB**.

* launch [Maestro].

  ```bash
  maestro test FranklinWH.yaml # or Off-Grid.yaml
  ```

### Finish phone / tablet

* press **back** twice to end [FranklinWH].
* click **Disconnect** in [HTTP Toolkit].

### Finish desktop

* examine the conversation generated by [FranklinWH], or
* export the conversation, which requires a [license](https://httptoolkit.com/pricing/).
  * optionally [sanitize](bin/sanitize) the HAR file:

    ```bash
    echo Jack: John >bin/secrets.yaml # add as required
    for f in captures/*.har; do
      bin/sanitize $f >${f/har/json}
    done
    ```

* save the logs at `~/.maestro/tests/` to compare times.
